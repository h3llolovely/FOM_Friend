applying effects in Adobe Aftereffects CS4.
For comments and suggestions definitly drop me a line.
	
Inspired by Lazy Layer Creator by Justin G and Quick_Fx_Palette 
by Fred Cretet. Thanks to Paul Tuersley for the try/catch part.

 Name: rd_MergeProjects
 Version: 3.2
 
 Description:
 This script displays a palette with controls for merging a selected project folder's
 contents up to the root of the Project panel. Use this script when you have imported
 a project into another, and want to merge subfolders and their contents with existing
 same-named subfolders at the root-level of the project, keeping your Project panel 
 more organized.
 
 Prerequisites:
  -- This script requires After Effects CS4 or later.
 
 Usage:
  1. (Optional) Select a top-level folder (representing an imported project) in the 
     Project panel.
  2. Select if you want to consolidate all footage/folder items (equivalent to the
     File > Consolidate All Footage menu command) and remove unused footage/folder
     items (File > Remove Unused Footage) before folder are merged.
  3. Click the Merge Project button.
 
 If you did not select a folder in step 1, you are asked to select the project file to
 import (equivalent to File > Import > File). In either case, the project folder's
 contents are merged.
 
 Notes:
  -- Subfolder hierarchies are retained when "merged up", even if the contents include
     a folder with the same name as that of a root-level folder. However, if the
     source folder contains multiple subfolders of the same name, they will be
     combined in the target folder.
  -- Identical or identically named compositions are not merged or renumbered.
 
 Legal Notices:
 This script is provided "as is," without warranty of any kind, expressed or implied.
 In no event shall the script's author be held liable for any damages arising in any
 way from the use of this script.

Q Spans
Dec 2023 Original script by Matt Volp @TackStudio www.tackstudio.co
Dec 2023 Jason Schwarz www.hellolovely.tv

Sends either Composition marker spans or selected layer marker spans to the Render Queue and appends the marker comment to the filename.
Useful for queueing multiple parts of a single comp, without having to rename each output.
